// Answer:  Q1G3A1B2F3A1G2E4

/* Logical Reasoning:
This question is based on a certain code language. Understand the logic in the coding and answer the
following question. 
If PROCESSOR is coded as D4F3C5C1E1S1S1E3C6, what is the code for QUADRANT? */

/* Logic for plaintext to ciphertext conversion:
1) Convert each letter to its numerical placement in the alphabet (A=1...Z=26)
2) Choose any two factors that multiply to that value. If prime, choose that number and 1.
3) Convert the first factor to its alphabetic equivalent (1=A...26=Z)

/* Example
Plaintext:      P  R  O  C  E  S   S   O  R

# Equivalence:  16 18 15 3  5  19  19  15 18

Factors:        44 63 35 31 51 191 191 53 36

Ciphertext:     D4 F3 C5 C1 E1 S1  S1  E3 C6
